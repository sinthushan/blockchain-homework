# Case Study: Dapper Labs

## What is it:

Dapper Labs is a blockchain game based company. The company is based in Vancouver, Canada and was founded in 2018. There most notable games currently are CryptoKitties which allows user to own and breed unique digital cats as well as NBA Top Shot which allows users to trade and collect NBA highlights (similar to having basketball cards). The use of blockchain for these games mean what they own in the games are indeed theirs and can not be replicated.

Dapper Labs was born from Axion Zen a hub in Vancouver for startups. The company is privately held and had a recent injection of money from NBA owners to make there recent NBA Top Shot game. The company has around 85 employees and has raised around $51 million dollars.

Dapper Labs created cryptokitties and other games on the Ethereum blockchain but now has developed there own blockchain called Flow. Flow was first used recently for their NBA Top Shot game. Flow unlike other blockchains is meant for game and app development and was made for saling in mind. The innovations of flow according to the Flow FAQ is as follows:

> A pipelined architecture that separates the jobs typically done by a single miner or validator across five different node types, significantly reducing redundant effort and improving efficiency.

> A new cryptographic technique we call Specialized Proofs of Confidential Knowledge (SPoCKs) to address the Verifier’s Dilemma.

> A single shared state for all smart contracts, ensuring that each transaction has full ACID guarantees. This unlocks rich interactions between smart contracts (“Composability”) and creates strong network effects for apps built on Flow.

Flow divides the normal miner validator relationship into 4 new roles Collector Nodes, Execution Nodes, Verifier Nodes, Consensus Nodes. according to the flow Primer the Collector Nodes increase efficiency, the execution Nodes enable speed and scale, the verifier nodes guarantee correctness and the Consensus Nodes ensure decentralization.

## Why This Matters:

THe reason Dapper Labs is important is because of their Flow Blockchain. Unlike other blockchains the Flow bloackchain is made for developer ease. Flow does this by offering built-in logging support, upgradeable smart contracts so that you can easily patch bugs, and fast guarantee the a transaction was executed on the blockchain. Flow also comes with it's own easy to use programming language called Cadence.

## Why This May be Interesting

Dapper Labs and what they are doing with their Flow blockchain is interesting because it opens up the ability to apply blockchain in realms outside of finance and business. By giving developers a platform to easily and quickly make apps we can see blockchain be used for many other things like games and application.
